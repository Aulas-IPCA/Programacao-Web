    <p>All modern websites and web applications emare built using three fundamental technologies: <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong>. These are the languages of the web.</p>

    <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
    
    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>

    <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
    
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>The opening tag</li>
    <li>The closing tag</li>
    <li>The actual element</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You can learn more at the MDN Web Docs.</p>
    
    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
    
    <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>
    
    <ol><li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
    <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Wordpress</li>
    <li>To build web applications</li>
    <li>To impress friends</li>
    <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
